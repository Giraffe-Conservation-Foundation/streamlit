# âœ… Logo Issue Resolved - Transparency Preserved!

## What Was Fixed
Your logo was showing as a white square because the transparency was being converted to a white background. Now the logo displays properly with transparency preserved.

## Changes Made
1. **Removed background conversion**: No more RGBA to RGB conversion that was adding white backgrounds
2. **Preserved transparency**: Your PNG transparency is now maintained
3. **Simplified layout**: Clean column layout without forced background colors
4. **Default Streamlit theme**: Works perfectly on Streamlit's default background

## How to Test
Run your app now with:
```
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

Or double-click `run_app.bat`

## Expected Result
- âœ… Logo displays with proper transparency
- âœ… No white squares or backgrounds
- âœ… Clean appearance on default Streamlit background
- âœ… Logo alongside "Giraffe Conservation Foundation" header

Your logo should now display beautifully! ðŸ¦’âœ¨
